# Pace Calculator

### What is this?

I noticed that I've used a running pace calculator and a rowing pace calculator but I haven't seen one that combines everything. I also added swimming so I don't have to do as much math when I'm swimming as well.

### Where can I find this?

This application is hosted on Heroku as [pacecal](http://pacecal.herokuapp.com). It's automatically deployed on every merge to master.

### How to run

You must have [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) installed to run this application. Also recommended is [RVM](https://rvm.io) because you will need to install [Ruby version 2.6.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/12/25/ruby-2-6-0-released/).
```
gem install bundler
bundle install
rails s
```

### Tests

There should definitely be tests! I will be using Rspec, but I spiked this for fun over Christmas and haven't written tests yet ðŸ˜³. If you want to contribute, it would be appreciated.

### How to contribute

Fork this repo and submit a PR against master when you are ready!
