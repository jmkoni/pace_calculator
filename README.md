# Pace Calculator

### What is this?

I noticed that I've used a running pace calculator and a rowing pace calculator but I haven't seen one that combines everything. I also added swimming so I don't have to do as much math when I'm swimming as well.

### Where can I find this?

This application is hosted on Heroku as [pacecal](http://pacecal.herokuapp.com). It's automatically deployed on every merge to main.

### How to run

Using whatever version manager you prefer, install Ruby 3.3.4 and run:

``` sh
bin/setup
```

### Tests

There are some tests. And there are some skipped tests due to bugs! I welcome contributions.

### How to contribute

Fork this repo and submit a PR against master when you are ready!
